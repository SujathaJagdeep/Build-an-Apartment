# Build an Apartment
Starter project for the Udacity [VR Developer Nanodegree](http://udacity.com/vr) program.

- Course: VR Scenes & Objects

### Versions Used
- [Unity LTS Release 2017.4.19](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2017.4)
- [GVR SDK for Unity v1.170.0](https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/releases/tag/v1.170.0)


### Directory Structure
- The Unity project is the child directory of the repository and named according to the associated lesson.
- The Unity project is 'cleaned' and includes my 'Assets', Build', 'ProjectSettings', and 'Screenshots' folders, along with the README.md file. 
- The Unity project does not include the 'Temp, 'Library', 'Packages', and 'UnityPackageManager' folders, as they have been deleted.


### GVR SDK for Unity
- `GoogleVR` > `Demos` is not included.
- `GoogleVR` > `GVRVideoPlayer.unitypackage` is included.
- Scripts applicable to the course have been updated to reflect Unity's API change from `UnityEngine.VR` to `UnityEngine.XR`.

>**Note:** If for any reason you remove and re-import GVR SDK for Unity v1.170.0, make sure you accept any API update pop-up prompts triggered by Unity. Alternatively, you can manually run the API updater (Unity menu `Assets` > `Run API Updater...`) after the import has completed.

### My Changes on the Final Project
- I have used more than 15 models arranged in an interesting way to clearly distinguish between various living spaces in my apartment.
- I have marked all models as "Static", except the Globe.
- I have ensured that the Google Daydream view with recticle appears and functions accurately, when I run the scene in Unity.
- I have tested the scene on my Android phone to ensure that the Google Daydream stereoscopic view with recticle appears and functions accurately.
- I have set the "Player" and "Quality" settings accurately prior to deploying the app onto my Android phone.
- I have taken four screenshots of various living spaces in "My Apartment" while the app was running on my Android phone for submission.
- I have used various lights such as a directional light, along with area, point and spot lights to light-up "My Apartment".
- I have marked all lights as "Static" and ensured that all of them are baked.
- I have used all the lightmap settings as per the project specifications.
- I have used a globe such that it is clearly visible in the scene.
- I have tested the globe on my Android phone to ensure that it spins in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions when I press the Google Daydream button until I press the button again.
- I have assigned the texture map of the Earth for the Globe. 
- I have worked really hard to ensure that "My Apartment" has an attractive model placement and nice baked lighting. 
- I have added a background city sound such as starting a vehicle engine.
- I have also added other apartment sounds such as opening of doors and windows, music playing on the TV, human footsteps on wooden floor for the recticle, and opening/closing of cabinets in the kitchen.
- I wish to further improve upon the sounds by spatializing them in the near future.

### My Reflection and Conclusion
- I took almost a week to complete "My Apartment", as I worked on it very closely to ensure that it meets all the project specifications.
- I love working in Unity 3D, as I have keen interest to learn using it inside out. Therefore, I liked almost everything about the project.
- I really enjoyed the fact that I was able to build "My Apartment" from scratch.
- I have animated the Globe. 
- I really enjoyed developing my 'Build an Apartment App' with all the optional features and learned a lot during the process. 
- I am proud of my Final Project Output.

### Your Feedback Incorporated
- I have marked the Udacity Icon as Static.
- I have changed the directional light to realtime, along with adding another spot light to make the globe readily visible.
- I have made the globe to switch between spin and rest states, so that when the Google Cardboard button is pressed, the globe spins until you press the button again.
